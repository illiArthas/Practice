*** Intro to NodeJS ***
	Common Stacks:
		LAMP - Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP
		MEAN - MongoDB/Express.JS/Angular.JS/Node.js


	// You can use cloud9(c9.io) to use backend technologies in the browser
	// OR you can download server to run on your machine

** Interact with the console **
		// In JavaScript you interact with the console using
		// console.log(), but in NodeJS you interact with the
		// Command line by typing, 'node' it will then allow you
		// to type javascript code in the command line, for example

		Levi_Hugo/Desktop ~~ node
		>
		> 4 + 10
		> 4
		> "hello" + "world"
		'hello world'
		> function myDog() {
			// console.log("This is NodeJS command line!");
		}
		// Can't use alert() because it comes with the browser
		// To quit, type Ctrl + C twice


** To run a file **

	// First find the file, make sure 
	// you're in the right directory
	// then type
		
		node myFile.js

*** NPM ***
	// npm is the package manager for JavaScript
	// think of npm as importing jQuery, css for html
	// but npm is for importing libraries on the backend
	// libraries that people have already coded, so other
	// developers can use it


** NPM install library **

	// Installing an npm library is very easy, just type npm install  
	// then the name of the package you're downloading

	// To install
			npm install cat-me

	// To require goto the js file and then require at the top
			var mySomething = require("cat-me");

	// To use it
			console.log(mySomething());

	* Use 'npm install' to install a package
	* Use 'require()' to include a package
