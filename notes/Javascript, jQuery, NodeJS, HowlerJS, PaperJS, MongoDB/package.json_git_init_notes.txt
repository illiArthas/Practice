** What is package.json **

	package.json contains a bunch of meta data about a particular information 
	or package. And it ranges from the name, description, version number,
	dependencies (packages that's needed for the application to run).

** Get started **

	// To initialize a package.json type

	// npm init

	// Once you've done every details it will create a package.json for you
	
// From this point every npm install you do that has a --save on it
	
// Will be saved to your package.json
	// For example, you create a folder "myFolder"
	
/*
     
		First step is - npm init
     
		Second step is - Finish inputting the details from the console
     
		third step is - npm install express --save
	
*/     
	
// That will then save express into the dependency so you don't have to keep downloading it


	// During second step, you can ignore test command, git repo, keywords, and license
	// During second step, entry point can be the main js file
