How to write an object in Javascript:
	
	// Below is an example of how to make an Object constructor

	var myObj = {
		type: 'fancy',
		disposition: 'sunny'

	};

	// Below is another way of creating an Object. It's called literal notation


	var myObj = new Object();
	
	myObj.type = "fancy";
	myObj.disposition = "sunny";
