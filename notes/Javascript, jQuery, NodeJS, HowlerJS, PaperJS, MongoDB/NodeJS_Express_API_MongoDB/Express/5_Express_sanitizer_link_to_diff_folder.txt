** Link to different folder **	

	var express = require("express");
	var app = express();

	app.use(express.static("myCSSFolder"));	


** Using Express-sanitizer **

	// require
	var expressSanitizer = require("express-sanitizer");

	// tell app to use it, and make sure its AFTER body-parser
	app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));
	app.use(expressSanitizer());

	// sanitize is often used with <%- %>, this is to avoid scripts we dont want running
	// using sanitize is very simple, simply use req.sanitize() and put the text inside the param
	// this sanitizes the text and removes all the script tags, while still running html tags

	var sanitizedText = req.sanitize(req.body.blog.thisText);

	// better example is 

	var thisText = "My coolest enemy <script>alert('I hacked you!')</script>";
	var sanitizedText = req.sanitize(thisText);
