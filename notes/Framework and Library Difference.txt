** Difference Between a Framework and a Library **

	Difference is Inversion of Control. It means that when you call a library
	you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted, the framework
	controls you. 

	Basically, all the control flow is already in the framework,
	and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with
	your code. 

	A library on the other hand is a collection of functionality that you can call.
