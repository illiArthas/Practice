Math floor and random:

	Math.random will generate a random number between 0 and 1.
		Math.random();

	We then multiplied that number by 50, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.
		Math.random() * 50;
	
	Math.floor will round the number down to the nearest whole number.
		Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);
