** Hiding a folder and its files **

	'Options -Indexes' <-- without quotation marks this hides the folders and the files

	For example you have 2 folders app and public, if you want to hide the app folder

	You cd into the app folder and create a .htaccess, inside that file just type 'Options -Indexes'

	The app folder is now forbidden to be seen on the browser


** Direct into the main page (Home page) **
	
	// This whole .htaccess is inside the public folder
	// /php_mvc/public is the root folder, in XAMPP the root folder is htdocs
	// RewriteEngine On = allow rewrite
	// Options -Multiviews = This disables using myPage.php and myPage, '-' symbol means disable
	// The last 3 are:
	// RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d	// These two looks for a file 
	// RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f	// if the file doesn't exist, then go to RewriteRule below	
	// RewriteRule  ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]	// If a page doesn't exist then go here
	// index.php?url=$1 '$1' is a variable 
	// by default it looks like index.php?url=post   or in this case project/public/index.php?url=post
	// But by using the $1 variable it looks like index.php/post or project/public/post

	<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
		Options -Multiviews
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteBase /php_mvc/public
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteRule  ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
	</IfModule>
