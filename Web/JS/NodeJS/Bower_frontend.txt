** Bower **

	Bower is pretty much the same as npm, but for front-end 
	so npm is for downloading packages on the server-side,
	while bower is for downloading front-end packages.


** Using Bower **

	First npm install it:

		npm install -g bower

	CD into the projects folder, then install i.e. Bootstrap Angular and jQuery:

		bower install --save bootstrap angular jquery

	After installing, just link them in your file, the files are inside bower_compontents folder

		i.e.    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
		
				OR

			<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css">
