** Looking at this tells you where a file belongs **

	Model - is the database i.e. MySQL, MongoDB, etc.

	View  - is the client i.e. HTML / CSS / Javascript

	Controller - is the server i.e. PHP / RUBY / Python


** Interactions **

	The Model:
		- Adding and Retrieving Items from DB
		- Processing data from or to the database
		- Speaks ONLY with the Controller(server)

	The View:
		- If you go on a website, this is the only thing the user sees
		- Think of good old fashioned HTML/CSS
		- Speaks ONLY with the Controller(server)

	The Controller:
		- Processes GET/POST/PUT/DESTROY requests
		- All server-side logic
		- The Middle Man:
		   - Takes info from user
		   - Processes info and talks to the DB if needed
		   - Receives info from DB
		   - Speaks to View to explain presentation to viewer
